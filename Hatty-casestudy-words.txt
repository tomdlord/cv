The Challenge

To create a playful brand that represents Hatty personality and creative inspiration, whilst taking inspiration from the colours and forms of her handmade jesmonite products.


The Problem

Despite have a distinct style to her products, Hattys digital presence lacked consistency between platforms. This was caused through the lack of any sort of branding. When a potential customer would stumbled across her on Instagram, they would then be taken to a website that had no visual similarities. We needed to align all her online channels with her online portfolio and e-commerce store. 



The Solution

We created a fresh and playful brand focused around Hatty's use of bold colours and forms used within her work. A cohesive palette allows the brand to flex across a number of platforms, whether that be her e-commerce website, or her physical market stalls.
